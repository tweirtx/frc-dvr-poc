# frc-dvr-poc
A little proof of concept that records FRC event webcasts, splits the video into matches, and uploads the relevant (team or event) matches to a specified YouTube channel

# This project has moved!
As this was just a POC, it was written pretty terribly. Also it only supports FRC matches. Also it's not complete. Because I want to start over and I also want to support FTC matches, this project has moved to a repository with its new name: ReMatch. You can find it here: https://github.com/tweirtx/ReMatch/
